								<span class="bold under">2. Categories of
									Services/Service Agreements.</span> For greater certainty, the

        <p>
            <span class="bold">2.1. Term Services. </span>Term Services
            means any Services that you subscribe to for a Commitment Period
            as identified above with a corresponding Fido Agreement Term or
            Data Term. Every Term Service that you subscribe to constitutes
            a separate Agreement with us. We will not increase the monthly

            the amount of minutes or data included with, a Term Service
            during its Commitment Period.

            Services means any Services that you subscribe to on an ongoing

            are identified above without a corresponding Fido Agreement Term
            or Data Term, and every Month-to-Month Service that you
            subscribe to constitutes a separate Agreement with us. For more

            optional services, please refer to the current Fido brochures or
            visit fido.ca. We may change Month-to-Month Services in
            accordance with the Fido Terms and Conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">2.3. Pay-Per-Use Services. </span>Pay-Per-Use
            Services means any Services that you receive from Fido on a
            per-usage basis (which may be a one-time usage, or usage for a
            set period of time, such as one day or one week), but not on an
            ongoing basis. Pay-Per-Use Services available to you include the

									note that substantial roaming charges may be incurred if your
									device is taken outside the Fido network even if no services

            another carrier. Usage outside the Fido network will result in
            roaming charges. Such usage includes (but is not limited to):
            calling; text, picture and video messaging; and data usage
            (including, but not limited to, apps usage, email, instant

        <p class="bold under">3. Termination and Amendment</p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">3.1. General</span> You may terminate your
            Service at any time (in accordance with the Fido Terms and
            Conditions), including at the expiry of any Commitment Period,
            or make changes to your Service, by contacting us at
            1-888-481-3436. If you upgrade your device or change a Term
            Service, you may be required to renew your Commitment Period
            and/or enter into a new Agreement with us for a new Commitment
            Period.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">3.2. Automatic Extension</span> At the end of
            your Commitment Period, your plan will automatically default to
            a month-to-month term. Fido may contact you at any time to
            propose a renewal of your plan. If you do not wish to renew your
            plan when contacted, you will retain your existing plan and your
            existing agreement with us, unchanged, until those are changed
            or terminated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement
            governing that plan.

        <p>
								<span class="bold">3.3. Device Savings Recovery Fee
									(applicable to Term Services only for any new term entered into
									on or after January 22, 2012).</span> A Device Savings Recovery Fee
            (DSRF) applies if you were given an economic inducement when you
            agreed to your new term, and if, for any reason, your service or
            your new term is terminated prior to the end of the term of your
            Agreement (Fido Agreement Term). The DSRF is equal to the
            economic inducement multiplied by the number of months remaining
            in your Fido Agreement Term divided by the total number of
            months of your Fido Agreement Term (plus applicable taxes). In
            other words, <span class="bold">DSRF = Economic
									Inducement x # months left in your Fido Agreement Term ÷ Total
									# months in your Fido Agreement Term + applicable taxes. </span> <br>
            An Additional Device Savings Recovery Fee (ADSRF) also applies
            if, for any reason, your data option, or your data option’s
            commitment term (Data Term), is terminated prior to the end of
            your Data Term. The ADSRF is based on the additional economic
            inducement you received for subscribing to your data option, is
            calculated using the same formula used to calculate the DSRF
            (but substituting Economic Inducement with Additional Economic
            Inducement and Fido Agreement Term with Data Term), and applies
            in addition to the DSRF for termination of your Agreement. <span
                class="bold">If you subscribe to a plan combining both
									voice and data services, both the DSRF and the ADSRF apply. </span><br>
            If you subscribed to Term Services on a new term prior to
            January 22, 2012, then an Early Cancellation Fee and/or Data
            Early Cancellation Fee will be calculated and charged as set out
            in the service agreement you received upon entering that term.
        </p>

        <p>
								<span class="bold">3.4. Service Deactivation Fee
									(applicable to Term Services only for any new term entered into
									between January 22, 2012 and December 1, 2013). Not applicable
									to Residents of Manitoba, Residents of Newfoundland for any new
									term entered into on or after September 27, 2012, Residents of
									Nova Scotia for any new term entered into on or after May 1,

            applies if, for any reason, your service is deactivated prior to
            the end of your Fido Agreement Term. This fee is in addition to
            any applicable DSRF or DSRF and ADSRF.
        </p>


        <p>
								<span class="bold">3.5. Satisfaction Guarantee. Fido may
									allow for the cancellation of your Service without any DSRF and
									a refund of the cost of your phone with the following

            condition to Fido within <span class="big">15</span> days from

        <p>
            <span class="bold">5.1. Security Deposit Conditions. </span> We
            may require you to provide us with a security deposit or impose
            other payment or credit requirements (e.g., interim payments;
            mandatory pre-payments; pre-approved card or bank payments) at
            any time and on such terms as determined in our sole discretion.
            Any security deposit you provide to us will be kept for a
            minimum of <span class="txtb">12</span> months, unless your
            Services are terminated sooner. After <span class="txtb">12</span>
            months, we may release and apply the security deposit against
            your account balance if we, in our sole discretion, determine
            that your payment history has been satisfactory or that you have
            otherwise met our financial criteria for the return of the

            percent, on the basis of the actual number of days in a year,
            accruing on a monthly basis. Interest is earned starting from
            the date we collect a security deposit from you (but no earlier
            than required under applicable legislation or regulation) until
            the date we return it to you.

            received by us by the required payment date specified by us and
            we may require you to replenish the security deposit after such
            use. We will notify you upon applying all or part of any
            security deposit. We will return to you any security deposit
            with applicable interest within 30 days of termination of your

        <p class="bold under">6. How Airtime and Long Distance
            Calling Are Charged</p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">6.1. Airtime Charges </span> Local and long
            distance airtime charges are rounded up to the next full minute.
            A one-minute minimum charge applies to every completed call
            (made or received). If you subscribed to a plan that was
            initially activated prior to July 4, 2012, monthly airtime
            charges will be billed by the second. The airtime for the entire
            call is charged based on the applicable rate at the beginning of
            the call. Airtime charges (plus long distance, if applicable)
            apply to completed calls from the time you press SEND until you
            press END. For international calls or while roaming, you may be
            charged from the time you press SEND until you press END
            regardless of whether the call is completed. Airtime charges
            (plus long distance, if applicable) apply to every call you
            answer on your wireless phone until you press END. Charges will
            start at the moment the calling party initiates the call by
            pressing SEND and includes the ring time.
        </p>

        <p>
								<span class="bold">6.2. Local and Long Distance Calling
									Areas. </span>Local calling areas are the areas in which you can make
            or receive calls without incurring long distance charges. Calls
            are defined as local or long distance based on local calling
            areas. If you subscribe to a zone-based plan, calls made or
            received outside the zone may incur additional fees. Your
            location at the time of the call, your wireless phone number and
            the phone number called are all important factors in determining
            local calling areas and wireless long distance. Your Incoming
            Local Calling Area is based on the geographical location
            associated with your wireless number. All calls that you receive
            while you are in your Incoming Local Calling Area are local. All
            calls that you receive while you are outside your Incoming Local
            Calling Area are long distance. Your Outgoing Local Calling Area
            is determined by your physical location. If you dial a number
            that is local to your physical location, then it is a local
            call. If you dial a number that is long distance to your
            physical location, then it is a long distance call. When using
            Call Forwarding, long distance charges apply when the number to
            which you forward the call is outside the geographical location
            associated with your wireless number, regardless of your
            physical location. Visit fido.ca/callingareas for more
            information and fido.ca/longdistance for current long distance
            rates.

        </ol>

        <p class="bold">Unlawful or Inappropriate Content</p>

        <p>Any Fido Party reserves the right to move, remove or
            refuse to post any content, in whole or in part, that it, in its
            sole discretion, decide are unacceptable, undesirable or in
            violation of the Terms or this AUP. This includes, without
            limitation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Obscene, profane, pornographic content;</li>
            <li>Defamatory, fraudulent or deceptive statements;</li>
            <li>Threatening, intimidating, abusive or harassing
                statements;
            </li>
            <li>Content that violates the privacy rights or
                intellectual property rights of others;
            </li>
            <li>Content that unlawfully promotes or incites hatred;</li>
            <li>Content that is otherwise offensive or objectionable;
                or
            </li>
            <li>Any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct
                that would constitute a criminal offence, give rise to civil
                liability or otherwise violate any municipal, provincial,
                federal or international law, order or regulation.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>For purposes of this AUP, "content" refers to all forms of
            communications including, without limitation, text, graphics
            (including photographs, illustrations, images, drawings, logos),
            executable programs, audiovisual recordings, and audio
            recordings.</p>

        <p class="bold">Security</p>

        <p>As set out above, you are responsible for any misuse of
            the Services, by you or by any other person with access to the
            Services through your Equipment or your account. Therefore, you
            must take steps to ensure that others do not gain unauthorized
            access to the Services through any means, including, without
            limitation, wireless networking. The Services may not be used to
            breach the security of another user or to attempt to gain access
            to any other person’s equipment, software or data, without the
            knowledge and consent of such person. Additionally, the Services
            may not be used in any attempt to circumvent the user
            authentication or security of any host, network, or account,
            including, without limitation, accessing data not intended for
            you, logging into or making use of a server or account you are
            not expressly authorized to access, or probing the security of
            other networks. Use or distribution of tools designed for
            compromising security, such as password guessing programs,
            cracking tools, packet sniffers or network probing tools, is
            prohibited. You may not disrupt the Services. The Services also
            may not be used to interfere with computer networking or
            telecommunications services to any user, host or network,
            including, without limitation, denial of service attacks,
            flooding of a network, overloading a service, improper seizing
            and abuse of operator privileges and attempts to "crash" a host.
            The transmission or dissemination of any information or software
            that contains a virus or other harmful feature is also
            prohibited. You are solely responsible for the security of any
            device you choose to connect to the Services, including any data
            stored on that device. In particular, Fido recommends against
            enabling file sharing of any sort. Fido recommends that any
            files or services you do choose to make available for remote
            access be protected with a strong password or as otherwise
            appropriate. You agree to treat as confidential all access
            codes, personal identification numbers and/or other passwords
            that we may provide to you for use with the Services.</p>

        <p class="bold">Unsolicited Communications</p>

        <p>As set out above, the Services may not be used to send
            unsolicited, bulk or commercial messages or for any other
            unsolicited communications. This includes, without limitation,
            using automatic dialing and announcing devices to or otherwise
            make unsolicited voice or facsimile calls and bulk mailing of
            commercial advertising, informational announcements, charity
            requests, petitions for signatures and political or religious
            messages. Such communications may only be directed to those who
            have explicitly requested it. The Services may not be used to
            send messages to any individual who has indicated that he/she
            does not wish to receive messages from you. The Services may not
            be used to collect responses from unsolicited e-mail messages
            sent from accounts on other Internet hosts or e-mail services
            that violate this AUP or the acceptable use policy of any other
            Internet service provider. Moreover, unsolicited e- mail
            messages may not direct the recipient to any web site or other
            resource that uses the Services. Forging, altering or removing
            e-mail headers is prohibited. You may not reference any Fido
            network (for example, by including “Organization: Fido” in the
            header in any unsolicited e-mail even if that e-mail is not sent
            through a Fido network. “Mail bombing” is prohibited. That is,
            you may not send numerous copies of the same or substantially
            similar messages, nor may you send very large messages or files
            to a recipient with the intent to disrupt a server or account.
            The propagation of chain letters is similarly prohibited,
            whether or not the recipient wishes to receive such mailings.
            Fido is not responsible for the forwarding of e-mail sent to any
            account that has been suspended or terminated. Such e-mail will
            be returned to sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily,
            at Fido’s sole discretion.</p>

        <p class="bold">User-Generated Content Services</p>

        <p>“User-Generated Content Services” or “UGC Services” refers
            to any services that allow an end user to post, upload or
            generate content online to be shared with a limited or unlimited
            number of recipients and may include, without limitation:
            newsgroups, online forums, message boards, chat programs,
            wiki’s, photo sharing services, customer review sites, video
            sharing services, blogs and web hosting.</p>

        <p>Any User-Generated Content Services accessed through the
            Services must be used in accordance with the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You must comply with the UGC Service’s written charter,
                policies or FAQs;
            </li>
            <li>You may only post advertisements, solicitations, or
                other commercial messages in the UGC Service if that service’s
                charter, policies or FAQs explicitly permit them;
            </li>
            <li>You are responsible for determining the policies of the
                UGC Service before using it;
            </li>
            <li>You must adhere to daily volume, file size and format
                restrictions of any UGC Service;
            </li>
            <li>Unless otherwise specified in the UGC Service’s
                charter, policies or FAQs, you must not forge, alter or remove
                any information from the UGC Service;
            </li>
            <li>The Fido Parties have no obligation to monitor the
                content of any UGC Service and the Fido Parties are not liable
                for any claims, losses, actions, proceedings, suits,
                liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and
                expenses arising out of or relating to the content of any such
                service;
            </li>
            <li>You must not use the UGC Service to perform “flooding”,
                which refers to deliberately repeating actions in quick
                succession in order to fill the screens of other Internet users
                with text or other content;
            </li>
            <li>Any device connected through the Services may not
                maintain more than two simultaneous chat connections including,
                without limitation, the use of automated programs, such as
                “bots” or “clones”. Automated programs may not be used when the
                account holder is not physically present at the device;
            </li>
            <li>You must not use the Services to send messages that
                disrupt another user’s equipment, software, hardware or user
                display; and
            </li>
            <li>You must not forge, alter or obscure your identity
                (other than using a nickname) while participating in the UGC
                Service.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="bold">Usage, Data Storage and Other Limitations</p>

        <p>You must comply with the then current usage, data storage
            and other limitations on your applicable Services. You must also
            ensure that your activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit,
            or degrade any other subscriber's use of the Services, nor
            represent (in the sole judgment of Fido) an unusually large
            burden on our networks. In addition, you must ensure that your
            activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade
            or impede Fido’s ability to deliver the Services, and monitor
            and investigate the Services, backbone, network nodes, and/or
            other network services or components. You may not resell, share,
            or otherwise distribute the Services or any portion thereof to
            any third party without the written consent of Fido. The
            Services are consumer products designed for personal purposes.
            For example, the Services do not provide the type of security,
            upstream performance and total downstream throughput capability
            typically associated with commercial use. You may not run a
            server in connection with the Services. You may not provide
            network services to others via the Services. In addition, you
            are prohibited from running servers for mail, http, ftp, irc,
            and dhcp, and multi-user interactive forums.</p>

        <p>Your use of the Services may be subject to a usage limit,
            as set out in your Agreement. If you exceed that limit, you may
            be subject to additional usage charges.</p>


        <p class="bold">Network Management</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to manage our networks in order to
            optimize their efficiency for the benefit of our subscribers,
            including, without limitation, by way of the following: rate
            limiting (speed), rejection or removal of spam or otherwise
            unsolicited bulk e-mail, anti- virus mechanisms, and protocol
            filtering. We may take any other action we deem appropriate in
            order to help ensure the integrity of the network experience for
            all subscribers.</p>

        <p class="bold">Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy</p>

        <p>As set out in the Terms, we have the right, but not the
            obligation, to monitor or investigate any content that is
            transmitted using the Services (other than voice Services) or
            the Equipment; and to access or preserve content or information
            in accordance with the Terms. We prefer to advise subscribers of
            inappropriate behavior and any necessary corrective action.
            However, if the Services are used in a way that we, in our sole
            discretion, believe violates this AUP, any of the Fido Parties
            may take any responsive actions they deem appropriate. Such
            actions may include, without limitation, temporary or permanent
            removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering
            of Internet transmissions, and/or the immediate suspension or
            termination of all or any portion of the Services or your
            account. The Fido Parties will have no liability for any such
            responsive actions. The above described actions are not
            exclusive remedies and the Fido Parties may take any other legal
            or technical action deemed appropriate. Upon termination of an
            account, any of the Fido Parties are authorized to delete any
            files, programs, data and e-mail messages associated with such
            account. The failure to enforce this AUP, for whatever reason,
            shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any
            time. If any portion of this AUP is held invalid or
            unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with
            applicable law as nearly as possible, and the remaining portions
            will remain in full force and effect. This AUP shall be
            exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with the
            governing law provision set out in the Terms.</p>

        <p class="bold">Complaints</p>

        <p>Please direct any complaints of violations of this AUP to
            or contact us at 1-888-481-3436. Questions or
            complaints, concerning third party content should be addressed
            to the applicable content provider.</p>
